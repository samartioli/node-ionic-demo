## Node Basics

Learn the basics of Node.js. What was it designed for? When and where should I use it? In this session, Sam Artioli will give an overview of the language and tools to get you started down the right path with Node. We will talk about Node's event driven architecture and non-blocking i/o. We will also walk through installing node & npm, and building a basic web server. As an added bonus we will take a look at using node as a cross-platform scripting tool. 

## Node as a Web API

Join Sam Artioli as he walks through Express and Restify, two popular web frameworks for Node.js. We will learn to identify which situations call for which framework. We will learn about middleware and how to take advantage of the vast amout of modules available in the community. The session will then focus on using the Request module and Redis to create a caching layer inside of node. Finally we will take a look at some advanced debugging and logging in Node. 

## Ionic

One code base to rule them all! Join Sam Artioli in taking a look at Ionic, a mobile application framework written in Angular.js and built on top of Cordova (a.k.a PhoneGap) In this session we will walk through the basics of getting ionic installed, adding and building platforms, and adding an angular service to our application. By the end of this session you will be ready to attack your next mobile project with Ionic. Launching iOS and Android at the same time!
